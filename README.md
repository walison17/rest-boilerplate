# Rest Boilerplate
This is my REST Framework template for all projects.
It's been standardized from the Makerlog codebase.
It also includes code to allow Paddle subscriptions.

### Setup
Start a new project with Django, install the requirements file in this repo, and copy-paste the accounts and billing apps. 
Then, use the settings.py as a guide to setup your project. Create a .env and you're set!
